# cpplox
cpplox is a compiler for the Alox Programming language. This project is undertaken with the sole purpose of acquiring knowledge and enhancing learning in the field of compilers. The following resources serve as references for the ongoing development of this project:

## Completed Features

- Lexer
- Expression parsing and evaluation
- Variable Declaration
- Control Flow ( IF Else, For and While Loops) parsing and evaluation
- Print statement utility
- Functions parsing and evaluation.
- Static scoping 
- Utilizing Make for build 

## Ongoing Feature Development


- Closures
- LLVM IR Generation
- Error handling 




## Planned Features


- Code Generation to LLVM IR: Currently, the Interpreter walks the AST tree to execute code, which is slow and inefficient. Generating LLVM IR could be a stepping stone in the transition to a compiled language.
- REPL : Have a read–eval–print loop as a command line feature
