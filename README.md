# cpplox
cpplox is a tree walk interpreter for the Lox Programming language. This project is undertaken with the sole purpose of acquiring knowledge and enhancing learning in the field of compilers. The following resources serve as references for the ongoing development of this project:

## Completed Features

- Lexer
- Expression parsing and evaluation
- Variable Declaration
- Control Flow ( IF Else, For and While Loops) parsing and evaluation
- Print statement utility
- Functions parsing and evaluation.

## Ongoing Feature Development

1. [ ] Static scoping and closures.
2. [ ] Classes 
3. [ ] Error handling 
4. [ ] Utilizing Make for build 



## Planned Features


- Code Generation to LLVM IR: Currently, the Interpreter walks the AST tree to execute code, which is slow and inefficient. Generating LLVM IR could be a stepping stone in the transition to a compiled language.
- REPL : Have a read–eval–print loop as a command line feature
