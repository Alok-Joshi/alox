# Alox Programming Language

## About

Alox is a statically typed, interpreted programming language that aims to balance simplicity and power. It was created with the following principles in mind:


## Features

## Tour of the Language

### 1. Variables

Variables are declared using the `var` keyword

```python
var: String a = 2;
```

### 2. Data Types

Alox supports two datatypes: Number and String

```python
var: String name = "John"
var: Number age = 30
```

### 3. Conditional Statements

You can use `if`, `else if`, and `else` for conditional branching.

```python
if(condition){
 //do something
}
else{
//do something

}
```

### 4. Loops

Alox offers both `for` and `while` loops.

#### For Loop

```python
for(var: Number i = 0; i<10; i = i +1 ){
      #code block
}
```

#### While Loop

```python
while(1){
    print 1;
}
    # code block
```

### 5. Functions

Define functions using the `func` keyword. You can specify parameters and return types.

```python
fun add(var: Number x, var: Number y){
    return x + y
}
```

### 6. Arrays and Lists

Create arrays and lists to store collections of data.

### 8. Exception Handling

Use `try`, `catch`, and `throw` for exception handling.
